## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **yarn install** to install all required dependencies
- **yarn dev** to start the local server
- **yarn test** to test, please run **yarn dev** to start the local server, **yarn knex migrate:latest --env development** to get a development database loaded up on your local machine, and **yarn knex seed:run --env development**, to seed that database with therequired files. You will need to reseed the database every time you run the tests!

## 2️⃣ Actions

🚫 This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

`addUser(user object)` --> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

PORT = Whatever free port you have open will work fine, if 4000 is not available.

DATABASE_URL = This environment variable does not need to be set up locally, but is set by Heroku when enabling the postgres addon.

DB_ENV = This will default to 'development'. If you wish to use testing, please run the script `yarn test` to run the app in the testing environment. This needs to be configured on Heroku to be set to 'production' (no quotes needed when setting the variable).
